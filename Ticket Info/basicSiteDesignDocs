We should make up some psd files to show what we want the site to look like.  They should be added into a new folder at 
root level called "documents".  This should be done after we choose a basic theme!


Work Log:
June 3rd, 2015 - James Collier
   Created a basic design template in photoshop.  Subject to change, but this will be a decent starting point, provided 
   you agree with the design descisions.  It is pretty basic, but that's kinda why I like it.
