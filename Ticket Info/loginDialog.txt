Description:
For desktop - create a login dialog box that slides down from the top right of the screen when the user clicks on 
the login button.  See http://jamescollier7.com/Oakridge2/index.html# .  The inputs don't need to connect into 
anything, they just need to be there, somewhat syled.
For Mobile - Try a couple different things.  A pop over, a slide down, a transformation.  It needs to be mobile-friendly, large fonts, and really easy and obvious.
