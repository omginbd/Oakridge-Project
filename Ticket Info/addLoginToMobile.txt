addLoginToMobile

The last item on the mobile menu should be a "login". It should be added via javascript in the buildMobileMenu() 
function in app.js  It should look like all the other menu items.  It should have the same structure (e.g. 
<a><div>login</div</a>) as the other menu items with the correct classes.  It should have an additional class 
that the javascript can latch on to.
