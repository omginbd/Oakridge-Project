We should maybe copy some of the basic html from the old site over, just so we have something to work with.

Work Log:
June 4, 2015
     Added in temporary markup. This needs to be looked at Michael.  Don't just approve.  Because I didn't use any
     Bootstrap and I want to see what you think of this. :)  Some of the things probably fit some Bootstrap features
     that we should use.  What do you think?
