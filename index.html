			<p>Oakridge Country Club is located midway between Ogden and Salt Lake City, Utah, in a beautiful area where the Great Salt Lake reaches the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains.  The view in any direction is spectacular.  The location, just off I-15 and only fifteen minutes from Salt Lake City, makes it a convenient place for business entertaining.  There is ample parking for any sized group.</p>
			<p>Rooms, which can accommodate from 10 to 200, may be reserved in advance for dinners, parties, meetings or any of your special events.  The banquet menu is extensive and competitively priced.  Oakridge is capable of making anything from a wedding to a business conference, a very special occasion.</p>
			<p>The Junior Olympic pool makes Oakridge an ideal place for family activities.  Swimming lessons and programs are offered from Memorial Day to Labor Day.</p>
			<p>From the Bar and Grill, overlooking one of the most beautiful golf courses in Utah, members and guests can enjoy gourmet dining and an impressive view of the majestic Wasatch Mountains.  The menu is varied and features exquisite seasonal selections.</p>
			<p>The Dining Room, with its fireplace and comfortable seating is the perfect place for friends to gather and relax in a pleasant atmosphere.</p>
			<p>The 18 hole championship golf course is a mature, tree-lined course with well trapped greens and plush conditions.  The course layout is challenging but enjoyable for all calibers of players.  The golf course features a choice of four sets of tee areas ranging from 5,327 yards on the front tee to 6,916 at the back tee markers.  These features combine to make the golf course one of the finest in the area.</p>
			<p>In comparison to Clubs, similar in size and amenities, Oakridge offers its members more value for their money.  Our prices are more reasonable, dues are less, and we have fewer capital needs.</p>
			<p>Thank you for your interest in Oakridge Country Club.  We look forward to hearing from you soon.  Feel free to contact the business office at 451-2229 or 295-9427 (SLC).  A tour of the facilities can also be arranged.</p>
